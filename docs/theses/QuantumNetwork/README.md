Description: Master thesis with Ben Lanyon. Theory of project based on relatively standard ion trap networking stuff, cavityQED, single photon generation, networking protocols. Project was actually focused on laser locking for the Raman scheme.  
Uses: Theory of cavityQED stuff is quite nicely done. Description of locking useful to know. I think I will be working on the same trap? The third trap in this three trap remote connection  thing at Innsbruck.
