Description: Half the project is setting up and characterising the new linear paul trap for the group. Then simple digital quantum simulations were performed. Good as a general overview of the how the ion trapping systems work. Project done under supervision of Christian Roos.  
Uses: General information about ion trapping systems. A reference for all the fundamental physics.
